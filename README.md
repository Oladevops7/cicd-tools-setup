Infrastructure Setup with Terraform: Jenkins, SonarQube, Sonatype Nexus, and Docker
This project provides a Terraform-based infrastructure setup to deploy and configure a Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline environment featuring Jenkins, SonarQube, Sonatype Nexus, and Docker.


Access the Services
Once the infrastructure is provisioned, you can access the services using the public IPs or DNS names provided in the output:

Jenkins: http://<jenkins_public_ip>:8080
SonarQube: http://<sonarqube_public_ip>:9000
Sonatype Nexus: http://<nexus_public_ip>:8081
Docker: You can SSH into the Docker server to manage your Docker containers.


Certainly! Below is a sample README.md file for a project that sets up Jenkins, SonarQube, Sonatype Nexus, and a Docker server using Terraform.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Terraform v1.x or later
AWS CLI (or any other cloud provider CLI if using a different provider)
An AWS (or other cloud provider) account with sufficient permissions
SSH Key Pair for accessing EC2 instances
Architecture
This Terraform configuration will set up the following components:

Jenkins: An open-source automation server used for building, testing, and deploying code.
SonarQube: A tool for continuous inspection of code quality, used for detecting bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities.
Sonatype Nexus: A repository manager that supports multiple repository formats, used for storing and managing binaries and build artifacts.
Docker: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
The infrastructure is set up as follows:

EC2 instances (or VM instances, depending on your cloud provider) for Jenkins, SonarQube, Sonatype Nexus, and Docker.
Security Groups configured to allow appropriate access to each service.
Persistent storage (EBS volumes for AWS) attached to each instance to store data for Jenkins, SonarQube, and Nexus.
VPC, subnets, and other networking components as required.
Terraform Modules
The project is divided into several Terraform modules:

VPC Module: Sets up a Virtual Private Cloud, subnets, and networking.
EC2 Module: Provisions EC2 instances and security groups for Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus, and Docker.
Storage Module: Creates and attaches EBS volumes for persistent storage.
Application Module: Handles the installation and configuration of Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus, and Docker on the provisioned instances.
Usage
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terraform-jenkins-sonarqube-nexus-docker.git
cd terraform-jenkins-sonarqube-nexus-docker
Initialize Terraform
bash
Copy code
terraform init
Customize Variables
Edit the variables.tf file to customize the configuration for your environment (e.g., instance types, region, SSH key pair, etc.).

Alternatively, you can create a terraform.tfvars file to override default variables.

Plan and Apply the Configuration
bash
Copy code
terraform plan
terraform apply
This will deploy the infrastructure. Review the plan output before applying to ensure everything is configured as expected.

Access the Services
Once the infrastructure is provisioned, you can access the services using the public IPs or DNS names provided in the output:

Jenkins: http://<jenkins_public_ip>:8080
SonarQube: http://<sonarqube_public_ip>:9000
Sonatype Nexus: http://<nexus_public_ip>:8081
Docker: You can SSH into the Docker server to manage your Docker containers.
Configuration
Jenkins
After accessing Jenkins, you will need to complete the initial setup by unlocking it using the password located at /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword on the Jenkins server.

SonarQube
SonarQube will be available on port 9000. You can log in with the default credentials (admin/admin) and configure your projects and quality profiles.

Sonatype Nexus
Nexus will be available on port 8081. The default admin credentials are admin/admin123. You can change the default password after logging in.

Docker
You can manage Docker containers by SSHing into the Docker server. Ensure Docker is installed and running.

Outputs
After the infrastructure is provisioned, Terraform will output the following information:

Jenkins Public IP
SonarQube Public IP
Nexus Public IP
Docker Server Public IP
